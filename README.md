continue with their studies for one last year. The only exception is if they have been accepted in a graduate
program and then they can continue their studies. There are two types of visa that students can apply for. The
first type is a student visa and the second is the work visa. Both of these visas are for students from
outside the USA. Students from the USA can apply for a student visa and then apply for a work visa once their
studies are complete. This is how students from outside the USA can come to the USA to study or to take up a
job. There are a few things you need to know when you are thinking about applying for an F 1 visa. The first
thing you need to have is a passport that has been issued by a country that is listed as a visa waiver by the
US immigration authorities. The second thing you will need to know is the country you wish to go to in the US.
It is important to make sure that they do not list you as a non-immigrant student. This is because the visa
waiver allows you to stay here and work or study, and you cannot work for your employer if you are not a non-
immigrant student. If you are not

Question 4 - The best way to invest $10,000 is

The best way to invest $10,000 isðŸ˜€ I would buy a $6000 1080ti and put the rest toward buying a $10000 1080ti.
It is a matter of choice, and how well you can use your resources. I think I would spend the money more wisely
by buying a couple of the best gaming PCs out there, with the best graphics cards, and just keep building
them. For me personally, I donâ€™t see any reason to invest in this type of stuff unless you are a gamer. I
would invest $5000 on a high-end laptop and use it for the best of what it can do. If I were buying a new PC,
I would buy one that has a top-of-the-line graphics card. That being said, I would also consider investing
$1500 in a good laptop, which would allow me to play games on the go. I would spend $5000 on a gaming computer
and buy a laptop. This is the first time i have ever spent money on a laptop, and I am not going to be a big
gamer. I would spend the money on a $100

This script print separately the question and the answer, and generate the answer in chat format. However, the answer is not connected with the question.

# Fine-tuning

Here, we showcase how you can fine-tune Openllama models.

## Setup

Before you run any of the scripts make sure you are logged in `wandb` (you need to create a account in https://wandb.ai/site):
```bash
wandb login
```

Now everything is done.

## Training
To fine-tune efficiently with a low cost, we use [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) library for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) training and [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes) for 4bit quantization. We also use the `SFTTrainer` from [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl).


For this example, we will fine-tune Openllama-3b on the `Ada` subset of [the-stack-dedup]([https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack-smol](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack-dedup)).

To launch the training:
```bash
nohup accelerate launch finetune.py \
        --model_id "/home/jcosta/openllama/open_llama_3b_finetuned/final_checkpoint" \
        --dataset_name "bigcode/the-stack-v2-dedup" \
        --subset "data/Python" \
        --dataset_text_field "content" \
        --split "train" \
        --max_seq_length 2048 \
        --max_steps 10000 \
        --micro_batch_size 2 \
        --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
        --learning_rate 3e-4 \
        --warmup_steps 1000 \
        --num_proc "$(nproc)"
```

Important: The arguments `dataset_name` and `subset` are not used. The dataset path and name are manually defineds in the code.
 
# Test and compare the base model with the finetuned model
To evaluate StarCoder2 and its derivatives, you can use the [BigCode-Evaluation-Harness](https://github.com/bigcode-project/bigcode-evaluation-harness) for evaluating Code LLMs.

The finetuned model as trained with this command, in a total of 0.05 epochs (Python dataset):
```bash
/home/jcosta/openllama/starcoder2/finetune.py --model_id /home/jcosta/openllama/open_llama_3b_finetuned/final_checkpoint --dataset_name bigcode/the-stack-v2-dedup --subset data/Python --dataset_text_field content --split train --max_seq_length 2048 --max_steps 10000 --micro_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 --learning_rate 3e-4 --warmup_steps 1000 --num_proc 26
```
And is trained with this comand too, in a total of 5 epochs (Ada dataset):
```bash
/home/jcosta/openllama/starcoder2/finetune.py --model_id /home/jcosta/openllama/open_llama_3b_finetuned/final_checkpoint --dataset_name bigcode/the-stack-v2-dedup --subset data/Python --dataset_text_field content --split train --max_seq_length 2048 --max_steps 10000 --micro_batch_size 2 --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 --learning_rate 3e-4 --warmup_steps 1000 --num_proc 26
```
However, in the last comand, the argument `max_steps` is not used, because the argument `num_train_epochs` is used in `scripts/finetune.py` script.

Below are some results from the test scripts comparing the baseline model with the finetuned model. For the full results, execute `scripts/open_llama_sanity_test3.py` (test baseline model) and `scripts/open_llama_sanity_test4.py` (test finetuned model). Results may variate.

## Script 3
This script test the base line model, using the same prompt set that will be used to test the finetuned model. In these scripts, we adjust the output max length to 128 new tokens. Tests 11-13 to test Python dataset and 14-17 to test Ada dataset.

Test 11 --------------------------------
Testing if the model can answer may complete with similar functions present in the Python dataset.
Complete code in dataset:
```bash
modes = ['r', 'w', 'a', 'r+'] 

def validate_file_name(file_name): 
  if file_name > '': 
    return True 
  return False 

def validate_bucket_name(bucket_name): 
  if bucket_name > '': 
    return True 
  return False 

def validate_location(location): 
  if location > '': 
    return True 
  return False 

def validate_mode(mode): 
  if mode in modes: 
    return True 
  return False
```

Prompt(present in dataset to finetune):
```bash
<s> modes = ['r', 'w', 'a', 'r+']

def validate_file_name(file_name):
    if file_name > '':
        return True
    return False
```
Answer:
```bash
def validate_mode(mode):
    if mode > '':
        return True
    return False

def validate_file_path(file_path):
    if file_path > '':
        return True
    return False

def validate_file_size(file_size):
    if file_size > 0:
        return True
    return False

def validate_file_content(file_content):
    if file_content > '':
        return True
    return False

def validate_file_content_type(file_content
```

Test 12 --------------------------------
Complete code:
```bash
N = input()

N = int(N) 
heights = heights_str.split() 
heights = [int(h) for h in heights] 
heights.sort(reverse=True) 
stalls = stalls_str.split() 
stalls = [int(s) for s in stalls] 
stalls.sort(reverse=True) 
#print(N) 
#print(heights) 
#print(stalls) 
cnt = 0

def read_outputs(output_file: str) -> List[int]:
    """Reads the outputs from the file and returns them as a list."""
    outputs: List[int] = []
    with pathlib
```

In tests 11-13, the model can`t answer with similar code to finetuning dataset code (probably because it wasn't trained enough).

This test answer continue with a lot of blank spaces. The model complete using the `Digital_Write` function and the same arguments of the training dataset (is not a perfect answer but indicate traces of learning).

Test 15 --------------------------------
Complete code:
```bash
with Text_Io; use Text_Io; 
with Revisions; use Revisions; 

procedure Test is 
begin 
    Put_Line(BUILD_TIME); 
    Put_Line(REPO_URL); 
    Put_Line("Branch " & BRANCH_NAME ); 
    Put_Line("Long Commit Id " & LONG_COMMIT_ID ); 
end Test ;
```
Prompt:
```bash
<s> with Text_Io; use Text_Io;
with Revisions; use Revisions;

procedure Test is
begin
```
Answer:
```bash
   Put_Line ("Hello World!");
end Test;
</s>
```
In this test, the model answer with a Put_Line command (is not a good answer but may indicate traces of learning).

Test 16 --------------------------------
Complete code: same of Test 14, line of prompt: 5.
Prompt
```bash
<s> TimeNow := Ada.Real_Time.Clock;
```
Answer:
```bash
procedure Main is
begin
  Ada.Real_Time.Delay_Until(TimeNow + Ada.Real_Time.Milliseconds(1000));
end Main;
```
In this test, the model mixes up a bit the dataset code used for finetuning but shows some traces of learning.
